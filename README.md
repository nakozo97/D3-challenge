## Background

- - -

A significant metro paper recently hired me as the new data visualization analyst to analyze the current trends shaping people's lives by creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand our editorial staff's findings on the `Healthcare vs. Poverty` USA state report. 

Our findings below were generated using information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. The dataset includes government findings based on the 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: [https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml)].
